'''
    Ask the player for their name.
    Display a message that greets them and introduces them to the game world.
    Present them with a choice between two doors.
    If they choose the left door, they'll see an empty room.
    If they choose the right door, then they encounter a dragon.
    In both cases, they have the option to return to the previous room or interact further.
    When in the seemingly empty room, they can choose to look around. If they do so, they will find a has_sword. They can choose to take it or leave it.
    When encountering the dragon, they have the choice to fight it.
    If they have the has_sword from the other room, then they will be able to defeat it and win the game.
    If they don't have the has_sword, then they will be eaten by the dragon and lose the game.
